#  SatelliteGuard

I made this because i did not want to pay **20â‚¬** for Paspasomething to use WireGuard on my AppleTV. So behold, made in only one day (10. Nov. 2024 evening -> 11. Nov. 2024 evening).

## Features

- E2EE CloudKit sync
- Pretty decent support for WireGuard edge cases (multiple peers, etc.)
- Uses wireguard-go under the hood
- Fucking awesome

Will this be released? Idk
I will turn this into a multiplatform WireGuard client first (iOS done, tvOS comes for free with some improvements, macOS next)
